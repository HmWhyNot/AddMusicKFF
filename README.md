# VirusRushTheater's fork of AddMusicKFF

This fork was made by VirusRushTheater in order to modify some aspects of
KungFuFurby's AddMusicKFF v1.0.8:

* Remove Visual Studio dependencies and use a CMake build based system.
* Tidy up program dependencies, moving them to the `deploy` folder.
* Make it multiplatform with minor modifications.
* Static Linkage with Asar, which would allow a more seamless integration.
* Compiling AddMusicKFF as a library, which would allow for more complex
  SMW hacking tools to integrate it easily.
